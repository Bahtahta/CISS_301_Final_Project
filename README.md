Project overview:

This github repository contains the final project for CISS 301: Discrete Structures for Cybersecurity
My project was to design and test malware using the bag-of-words philosophy. This takes similar key between files and compares them to get what answer you are looking for.
The python code written here takes this design and uses it to make an analyzer for malware or to look at the stings and dlls of an executable file using certain commands given in the file.
